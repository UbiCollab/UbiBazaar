<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>	We are five students taking the course IT2901(Project 2), 
	which is out bachelor thesis in computer science on NTNU.  
	
	We are implementing a server that will give users the possibility
	to upload applications and follow applications developed  
	or uploaded by other users. An Android client is also being developed.
